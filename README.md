## Overview

Used to add Firefox to a Debian system.

## Module Description

This module will install Firefox on a Debian machine and can replace the existing
"firefox" symbolic link that is associated with Iceweasel.

## Setup

### What debianfirefox affects

* Iceweasel
* Firefox

### Beginning with debianfirefox

Look up the specific version of firefox you want to install.
Specify this along with the other required parameters in a hiera file or
params.pp file.

## Usage
Install and replace the existing firefox symbolic link:

```
class { 'debianfirefox':
  version => '40.0.2',
  tarball_destination => '/opt/firefox-$version.tar.bz2',
  install_location => '/opt/firefox',
  link_location => '/usr/bin/firefox',
  replace_weasel_symlink => true,
}
```

Install without replacing the existing firefox symbolic link:

```
 class { 'debianfirefox':
   version => '40.0.2',
   tarball_destination => '/opt/firefox-$version.tar.bz2',
   install_location => '/opt/firefox',
   replace_weasel_symlink => false,
 }
 ```

## Limitations

This has been built to work with Debian only.
